# FEHM_templates
template files for FEHM run

This folder contains sample grids, scripts, and QC files created during the development of the FEHM_supplementary package.  

The most up-to-date method uses param_file_new.csv to set up a testing matrix and then uses setup_script.py to build each run folder and to build the run script.  The run script (FEHM_test_run.sh) then runs all of the tests.
